# Code-Quiz

## Description

As someone who enjoys the mix of education and entertainment, I created a project which quizzes the user with coding questions. While continuous practice is necessary for mastering coding, it should not stop anyone from treating it as fun as it can be and a quiz helps with treating this as a category from a quiz game.
